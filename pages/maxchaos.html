        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm <strong><em>MaxChaos,</em></strong> a young-adult he/him trans American,
        currently trying to learn the basics of programming, starting with the free online course
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths">The Odin Project!</a></p>
        <p>I'm currently not in school, but I am working at a donut shop. My goal is to eventually, within
            a year or two, learn enough coding to acquire a junior developer or IT job of some sort that
            pays more, and progress my way up into a high-paying, work from home tech job.
        </p>
        <p>I know the path will be long, hard, and difficult. Coding is about try, try again, fail, rinse,
            repeat, scream at the duck, sob at the closed forum questions that say 'nevermind I figured it out,
            thanks,' and wondering how your code that was working yesterday isn't working today. But the potential
            salary I could be making without formal education makes it well worth it, I just have to find the courage,
            persistence, and patience to try.
