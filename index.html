        <h2>The Start</h2>

        <p>This is my first website, which I will be updating as I learn HTML. At the moment, it's currently only intended to exist to
            show myself what I've learned so far, applying everything that I've learned into one site. This website is not required by
            Odin Project, and as such, is in 'My Projects' as a personal project.</p>
            <p><strong>Design elements are subject to change.</strong><em> I will be making frequent edits to the site and its
            layout.</em> This is because at the moment of writing this, I do not know any JavaScript or CSS, so everything
            is in pure, unformatted HTML. I will make it fancier later.</p>
            <h3>Things I have learned so far.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The basics of using and navigating in Unix shell.</li>
                <li>What Git and Github are, and their use in a good workflow.</li>
                <li>Linking my computer to Github, and creating a Github repository.</li>
                <li>How to ask good questions and learn from them.</li>
                <li>How programming will become more challenging to learn as resources wane.</li>
                <li>The basics of VSCode.</li>
                <li>Setting up dual-boot Linux on my computer.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Things I am excited to learn.</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>CSS and JavaScript to format my website.</li>
                <li>How website security works, when it comes to programming, and potentially how to find security flaws in websites.</li>
                <li>How to design a good, personalized site, which I could use to help my friends with their carrd and such.</li>
                <li>How to make my site work on any browser, on any device.</li>
            </ol>
